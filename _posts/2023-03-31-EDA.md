## What is EDA?

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an approach to analyzing and summarizing datasets to gain insights and discover patterns, relationships, and anomalies.

The main goal of EDA is to help analysts understand the structure and content of their data, identify potential problems such as missing or inconsistent data, and determine the appropriate methods and techniques to apply in subsequent analysis. Common techniques used in EDA include data visualization, descriptive statistics, and data transformation.

## Advanced stats

While traditional stats like points, rebounds, and assists have been the cornerstone of basketball analysis for many years, they only provide a limited view of a player's performance. Advanced stats like Player Efficiency Rating (PER), True Shooting Percentage (TS%) offer a more comprehensive picture by considering factors such as efficiency, context, and predictive power.

For example, TS% evaluates a player's scoring efficiency by taking into account not only field goal percentage but also free throw and three-point shooting accuracy.

By using advanced stats, coaches, scouts, and analysts are able to gain a more nuanced understanding of a player's value and make more informed decisions when it comes to drafting, trading, or signing players.

## Scoring leaders' True shooting percentage

In the previous post, we used api call to obtain the 2013-14 nba traditional players stats. Today we will transfer these data to advance stats and see if the scoring leaders also have a good scoring efficiency.

# First, let us find the top 15 scorers in the 13-14 season:

Setting up and import data:

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'png'
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

# Reading datasets/coinmarketcap_06122017.csv into pandas
data = pd.read_csv('/Users/christian/Desktop/STAT386/NBAData/NBA2013_14Stats.csv')
```

Then, we use calculate the advance stat "True Shooting Percentage" and store in the dataframe:

```
#Create a new column for TS%
data['TS%'] = data['PTS'] / (2 * (data['FGA'] + 0.44 * data['FTA']))
#Filter top 15 scoring leaders
top_15 = data.nlargest(15, 'PTS')
top_15
```

# Now we get the scoring leaders

```
# Select the PLAYER and PTS columns for the top 15 players
top_15_scorer = top_15[['PLAYER','PTS']]

# Create a bar chart of the top 15 players by points
plt.bar(top_15_scorer['PLAYER'], top_15_scorer['PTS'])

# Add labels for each bar based on the player name


# Set the x-axis tick labels to be rotated 30 degrees and aligned with the bars
plt.xticks(range(len(top_15_scorer)), top_15_scorer['PLAYER'], fontsize=8, rotation=30, ha='right')

# Add axis labels and title
plt.xlabel('Players')
plt.ylabel('Average Point per Game')
plt.title('Top 15 Players by Points')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

From this plot, we can see that Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James are the top scorers in NBA. Although they score a lot of points each game, do they score effectively? Or they have a high average score just because they attempt a lot?

# use panda to create the dataframe, create a foundation of our dataframe.

Now, look at this plot with advance stats:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Filter the top_15 dataframe to only include the relevant columns

# Create the dot plot
plt.scatter(top_15_filtered['PTS'], top_15_filtered['TS%'], s = 38)

# Add labels for each point based on PLAYER_ID
for i, row in top_15_filtered.iterrows():
    plt.text(row['PTS'], row['TS%'], row['PLAYER'], fontsize=10 ,rotation = 30)

# Add axis labels and title
plt.xlabel('PTS')
plt.ylabel('TS%')
plt.title('Top 15 Players by Points and True Shooting Percentage')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```

Through this plot, we can see that although being the top scoring leader in the NBA, Kevin Durant has a very good scoring effiency in the league. He was actually the mvp for the season. Carmelo Anthony on the other hand, dispite being the 2nd scoring leader with averaging 27.4 points per game, has a much lower scoring effiency. 3 years later after his contract ended, he was traded to Oklahoma City Thunders, and graduately disappered in the league.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial approach for analyzing and summarizing datasets to gain insights, identify potential problems, and determine appropriate methods for subsequent analysis.
