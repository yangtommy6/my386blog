## Introduction

Basketball is my favorite sport. In recent years, the NBA has seen a massive surge in popularity, with fans from all over the world tuning in to watch their favorite teams and players compete. As basketball becomes more and more data-driven, there has been a growing demand for access to NBA player data from past seasons. In this post, we will explore how to use the NBA API to collect player data from the 2013-2014 NBA season. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of how to use APIs to access NBA player data, and you will be able to use the same techniques to collect data from other seasons or sports leagues as well. So, let's get started!

## What I choose this dataset/Ethics

I chose to use the API in NBA.com/stats because it is the official statistics provider for the NBA, ensuring that the data we collect is accurate and up-to-date. NBA.com doesn't allow people to use their advanced stats, but traditional stats, like the one we are using today, is allowed.

## Gather the data using the api

# First, let us import the necessary libraries:

```
import requests
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
from html.parser import HTMLParser
```

Then, we use request.get()to get the data from the api:

```
#get api
r = requests.get(url = 'https://stats.nba.com/stats/leagueLeaders?LeagueID=00&PerMode=PerGame&Scope=S&Season=2013-14&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&StatCategory=PTS').json()
```

Note: To find this json api, first we will go to nba.com/stats and find the traditional stat we want. After you decide the stats you want to work on, right-click on the table, and choose "Inspect".

Then, the developer tool will pop up at the right. Go to Network, and choose "Fetch/XHR"

Here, you will see a list of all network requests made by JavaScript fetch or XHR API calls, respectively. For each request, you can see information such as the URL of the request, the HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.), the status code returned by the server, the size of the response, and the time it took for the request to complete.

We can play around it, but eventually we want to find a api that has the data we want. In this example, we found the API start with "leagueLeaders" is helpful:

If we click it, we can see the raw json:

# Now we get the headers of the table we want

```
table_headers = r['resultSet']['headers']
table_headers
```

# use panda to create the dataframe, create a foundation of our dataframe.

```
nbastats = pd.DataFrame(r['resultSet']['rowset'], columns=table_headers)
nbastats
```

Lastly, we export the dataframe to csv:

```
nbastats.to_csv('NBA2013_14Stats.csv')
```

## Conclusion

With the api call, it's very easy to grab the data online and export them to csv. We then can start to analyst the data and create meaningful reports.
