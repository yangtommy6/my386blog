## Introduction

In this data-driven project, we have explored the 2013-14 NBA player stats dataset to gain insights into player performance. Our initial motivation was to investigate the relationship between scoring and efficiency, using advanced stats like True Shooting Percentage (TS%). Our analysis aimed to determine if the top scorers in the league also demonstrated efficient shooting. To accomplish this, we have used Python to clean, process, and visualize the dataset.

## Data Story

The data analysis primarily focused on comparing the top 15 scorers' points per game with their respective TS%. The results show that some players, like Kevin Durant and LeBron James, not only scored a significant number of points per game but also displayed high shooting efficiency. However, others like Carmelo Anthony, despite being among the top scorers, had lower efficiency.

This line chart shows a side-by-side comparison of each player's points per game and TS%. The left y-axis represents the points per game, while the right y-axis indicates the TS%. We can observe that Kevin Durant and LeBron James are among the highest in both categories. However, Carmelo Anthony has a lower TS% compared to his points per game, which may indicate lower shooting efficiency.

## Project Summary

Throughout this project, we have collected and processed data on NBA player stats for the 2013-14 season, using Python to perform exploratory data analysis and generate insightful visualizations. We have also calculated advanced stats like TS% to better understand player efficiency in scoring.

Our data story highlights the relationship between scoring and efficiency, illustrating that not all top scorers have high shooting efficiency. This analysis demonstrates the importance of considering advanced stats when evaluating player performance, as they provide a more comprehensive understanding of a player's value on the court.
